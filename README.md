URE is a class library of smart classes which work together to create a typical
roguelike game environment based on 2D cell grids, turn-based action, and procedural
content.  It can emulate all the conventions of a normal singleplayer roguelike such
as Nethack, but is not limited to these conventions.  Users can use URE simply as a
display layer, as a full world abstraction manager, or take full advtanage of its
object library and use a conventional roguelike as an immediate jumping-off point
to create from.

## Contributing to URE

URE is an open source community project and the maintainers welcome contributions from
the community.  We aim to provide a comprehensive library of useful game objects and
functionality covering as wide a variety of use cases as possible.  If you've made a
generally useful Thing, Behavior, Action, Terrain, or other entity type, ping us with your
branch and we'd be happy to consider merging it back.

URE is built with the SBT build system and depends on LWJGL, Jackson and Reflection.
