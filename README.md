URE is a class library of smart classes which work together to create a typical
roguelike game environment based on 2D cell grids, turn-based action, and procedural
content.  It can emulate all the conventions of a normal singleplayer roguelike such
as Nethack, but is not limited to these conventions.  Users can use URE simply as a
display layer, as a full world abstraction manager, or take full advtanage of its
object library and use a conventional roguelike as an immediate jumping-off point
to create from.

To get started with URE, take a look at the included ExampleGame package.
