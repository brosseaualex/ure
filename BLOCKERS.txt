Blocking Issues

we have a lot to work on but here are the things I see blocking progress on the most other things:


- Area Freeze/Thaw

We need persistent areas so we can flesh out the Cartographer and overall game structure.


- UIModal panel support

We need to be able to pop up UI modals.  This blocks almost all gameplay interaction such as 'interact', dropping items,
inventory, map dialogs, and so on.  This is probably the biggest blocker of the most things, I'm running out of stuff I can
implement without UI.  We also need this to work for non-square (transparent) overlays -- not just square modal windows, but
visual elements laid on top of the camera like a direction-picker or a target select reticule.  (ideally)


- Font Support

We can't change fonts anymore; our current font isn't really ideal, and users will expect and need to do it.  This isn't
hard-blocking any specific features but is necessary and makes it harder to more generally test the rendering to tweak it
to be generally attractive beyond our one font.  This also makes developing UI things problematic since we aren't using a
monospace font.


- Nail down rendering/panel positioning

This is mostly only blocking continued animation development; I didn't want to touch that stuff until this is all worked out.
This blocks things like actor glyph animation, movement-ghost animation, projectile animation, etc.  It also blocks
continued progress on the non-camera UI panels (since I don't know how their interfaces will shake out).
