I went through Area and followed its members all the way down looking for anything non-standard for serialization.
Any simple value or single-referenced object with simple values (etc...) I considered un-noteworthy.  That left the list below.
The EXT properties I took care of in Cartographer.freezeArea() (and Area.freezeForPersist() which it calls).

BACK = Reference back to the object containing this (a circular reference).

REF = Reference to other object in the area (a duplicate reference).  There's only one case of this, Area.actors, which only exists
for performance since those actors are actually kept track of by their containing UCollection in a Cell (the list exists to quickly
iterate it on an area tick).  We could just dump this on serialize and recreate it, if that's easiest.

EXT = external reference to not serialized object (ignore/null)


Area.lights
    Light.area (BACK)
Area.actors (REF) (these are in the cells also)
Area.listeners (EXT)
Area.commander (EXT)
Area.terrainCzar (EXT)
Area.cells
    UCell.area (BACK)
    UCell.terrain
    UCell.contents
        UCollection.container (BACK)
        UCollection.things
            Thing.location (BACK)
            Thing.contents -> .....
        UCollection.actors
            Actor.camera (EXT)
            Actor.UCommander (EXT)
            (Thing).location (BACK)
            (Thing).contents -> .....
