# Release roadmap

*NOTE: we are now developing on the develop branch.  This will be merged back to master when stable.*

URE is still in its early stages, and lacks critical features before it can truly support a full blown 'commercial quality'
roguelike.  Here's our intended roadmap of feature additions that will get us to that 1.0 state.

## 0.8

- ~~Particle system~~
- ~~better Landscaper generic method tools~~
- ~~Guava event bus~~
~~ogg playback, background music loop/crossfade, stereo SFX position~~
- ~~improved A* pathing~~
- ~~Main Menu modal with gamesave manager and title screen~~
- ~~ActorPanel UI display~~

## 0.9
- ~~Audio : ambient sounds, streaming~~
- ~~resize support~~
- ~~TrueType font support / separate text and glyph fonts~~
- ~~Map modal~~
- ~~Equipment~~

## 1.0
