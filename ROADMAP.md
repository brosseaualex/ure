# Release roadmap

URE is still in its early stages, and lacks critical features before it can truly support a full blown 'commercial quality'
roguelike.  Here's our intended roadmap of feature additions that will get us to that 1.0 state.

## 0.8

- ~~Particle system~~
- Vault stamping support in Landscaper
- JSON configuration of main window layout, with resize support
- better Landscaper generic method tools
- Guava event bus

## 0.9
- Audio : ogg playback, background music loop/crossfade, stereo SFX position, ambient sounds tied to entities
- improved A* pathing
- Main Menu modal with gamesave manager and title screen
- ~~ActorPanel UI display~~
- Actor AI behavior set

## 1.0
- TrueType font support / separate text and glyph fonts, specified at runtime
- Camera zoom
- Map modal
- RexPaint entity sprites for UI display
- Status effects

## 1.1+
- Fluid/fire/gas cell simulation
